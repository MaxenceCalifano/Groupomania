# Groupomania

Groupomania is a corporate social network built with React for the frontend part, NodeJs and Express for the backend and has a MySQL database.

It is my 7th and last project from the Web Developer training program of OpenClassRooms.

## How to run it

- [ ] Step 1 : Clone it with the command `git clone https://github.com/MaxenceCalifano/Groupomania.git`
- [ ] Step 2 : Run `npm install` in each folder frontend and backend
- [ ] Step 3 : In the backend folder, find `.env` file, and type your MySQL user and password in `dbUser` and `dbPassword`
